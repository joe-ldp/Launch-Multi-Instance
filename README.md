# Multi/Wall Launch Script

- Opens Minecraft instances (requires MultiMC)
- Opens programs (like OBS, Ninbot, whatever else you want)
- Opens reset macro after instances have launched

Config is fairly straightforward. Just edit the macro and set your number of instances, and set paths for everything.
This script won't open programs that are already open.
